# Image-Denoising-Based-on-Traditional-Algorithm

*  This includes the most advanced traditional image denoising algorithms such as BM3D and NLM, while adding the variance estimation algorithm, so as to adaptively denoise the input image.

*  The program is configured to run on ARM development board X210, using Qt to develop the GUI.

*  "denoising.cpp" contains the main algorithms
